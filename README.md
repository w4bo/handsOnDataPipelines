# Hands On Data Pipelines

This lab will cover:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Big data elaboration on Spark
- Machine learning
- OLAP and data visualization

Each steps takes about 2 hours and consists of both theory (30/45 minutes) and practice.
At the end of each step, you will be provided with the solution of the exercise.

## Time schedule

## Technical requirements

How many of you are familiar with...

- Project versioning (`git`), dependency management (`venv`), and build automation (`gradle`)
- Coding (`python`, `scala`)
- Data manipulation (`pandas`), and machine learning (`sklearn`)
- Big data processing (`spark`) 
- OLAP and data visualization (`tableau`)

To join this lab, you need to "install" the above mentioned software.
