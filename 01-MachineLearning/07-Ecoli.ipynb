    "4. Split training and test data. When splitting train and test datasets, the test dataset should contain 30% of the data.\n",
    "5. Plot the training dataset in 2D, are the outcomes separated?\n",
    "6. Train at least two ML classification models; submissions are evaluated using the accuracy score.\n",
    "7. Perform hyperparameter optimization for at least one model"
